   - **Day 1 (07/06/21)**: I hope to learn more about computing because I am planning on majoring in Computer Science and a pursuing carrer in data science. I think AI could be useful for making the world more efficient. 
   - **Day 2 (07/07/21)**: I learned that you don't need to be loud or charasmatic to be a leader and that everyone, including myself, has the potential to be a leader. I learned that everyone has a unique story. I learned that my background is not boring and is unique. I have made a difference in my community because I make YouTube videos for my libraries YouTube channel where I teach seniors how to use technology.

 - **What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?**
 - In supervised learning, the input data is labled. The output of the data used for learning is already known. The computer needs to find the function that maps the inputs with their respective outputs. Unsupervised learning does not require output data. It finds patterns from the input data. 
 - **Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the
power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data
analysis libraries.** 
- This is false because Scikit-Learn is built on other packages like NumPy, Graphviz, and Pandas. Scikit is used for data mining and it requires other libraries to visualize that data.
 - **Day 4 (07/09/21)**
 - Deep learning could be used to identify tumors and cancers in brain scans. The specific deep learning algorithim that would need to be used for this is a CNN(Convolutional neural network). I picked this particular approach because the "neurons" in a CNN is aranged in such a way that they are able to recognize and process visual stimuli. I couldn't find a detailed data set for this problem, but I did find this image which includes multiple images: https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ3nA-oYMipzSgCv4Py3BMHCZHhT4adVtaWLw&usqp=CAU.
