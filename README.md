## Responses:
   - **Day 1 (07/06/21)**: I hope to learn more about computing because I am planning on majoring in Computer Science and a pursuing carrer in data science. I think AI could be useful for making the world more efficient. 
   - **Day 2 (07/07/21)**: I learned that you don't need to be loud or charasmatic to be a leader and that everyone, including myself, has the potential to be a leader. I learned that everyone has a unique story. I learned that my background is not boring and is unique. I have made a difference in my community because I make YouTube videos for my libraries YouTube channel where I teach seniors how to use technology.  
 - **Day 3 (07/08/21)**
 - **What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?**
 - In supervised learning, the input data is labled. The output of the data used for learning is already known. The computer needs to find the function that maps the inputs with their respective outputs. Unsupervised learning does not require output data. It finds patterns from the input data. 
 - **Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the
power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data
analysis libraries.** 
- This is false because Scikit-Learn is built on other packages like NumPy, Graphviz, and Pandas. Scikit is used for data mining and it requires other libraries to visualize that data.
 - **Day 4 (07/09/21)**: Deep learning could be used to identify tumors and cancers in brain scans. The specific deep learning algorithim that would need to be used for this is a CNN(Convolutional neural network). I picked this particular approach because the "neurons" in a CNN is aranged in such a way that they are able to recognize and process visual stimuli. I couldn't find a detailed data set for this problem, but I did find this image which includes multiple images: https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ3nA-oYMipzSgCv4Py3BMHCZHhT4adVtaWLw&usqp=CAU. 
 - **Day 7 (07/12/21)**: 
 - **What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning?**
 - A tensor is an array of real numbers or strings. A one dimensional array of numbers like one scalar number is a tensor. Multidimensional arrays like vectors and matricies are also tensors. A tensor can contain the following data types: floats, ints, complex numbers, strings.
 - **What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?**
 - I noticed that the computations involve multiple steps. First, you have to model the nerual network, then run the neural network, then train the neural network, then evauluate the results and then you can run it again if needed. I always assumed machine learning was a one step process programming wise.

-  The model with the extended data has the same accuracy as the model in the Kaggle tutorial. But, there are more epochs since there is more data, and the accuracy increases with the epochs. 
- **Day 10 (07/15/21)**: 
 - **How do you think Machine Learning or AI concepts were utilized in the design of this game?**
 - Machine learning and AI is used to read through applicants resumes and will use a machine learning algorithim to decide wether those applicants should be hired. This AI is trained by reading the resumes of previous applicants and seeing if they were hired or rejected in order to train the neural network. 
 - **Can you give a real-world example of a biased machine learning model, and share your ideas on how you make this model more fair, inclusive, an equitable? Please reflect on why you selected this specific biased model.**
 - One biased model is Apples Face ID technology. I selected this because I read an article about how Face ID had a harder time recognizing certian demographics faces. This could be because Apple does not have a diverse workforce or because Apple did not train it with a diverse selection of faces. Apple could make this model more fair by training on a wider variety of faces.
 - **Day 11 (07/16/21)**: 
 - Succinctly list the differences between a Convolutional Neural Network and a Fully Connected Neural Network. Discuss layers and their role, and applications of each of the two types of architectures in the Responses section of your README. Share the link with your mentor on your Localized team channel.
 - A Fully Connected Neural Network is a neural network in which the layers of the network are completley connected to each other. The individual neurons in each layer are connected to all the individual neurons in the other layer. This type of network could be adventagous because you don't need to make predictions or assumptions about the input data. But, the disadvantages of this network is that they have a large number of weights that require a very long time to train. They have a broad amount of applications. 
 - In a Convolutional Neural Network, it is assumed that the inputs are images. The layers in a Convolutional Neural Network have different purposes, unlike a FCNN. The layers in a CNN run much faster than in a FCNN. CNNs are mainly used for image data sets.

 -  **Day 15 (07/20/21)**:
 -  **Write a reflection piece on the advantages of the Rectified Linear activation function, along with one use case**
 -  Adavntages of  Rectified Linear activation function: You will not run into as many problems when training because the vanshing gradient issue will not occur. It only requires the max() function to implement, so its not hard to implement. 
 -  One use of  Rectified Linear activation functions is with image data combined with a CNN

 - I don't think my model is going to be very accurate at predicting age and gender. This is because it will not be good at predicting ethnicity because of the discrepencies in pictures between differet entichies.

 - Changing the loss to regression based functions led to a more stable accuracy graph. It stablized the loss instead of having the loss decrease.

 - GPT-2 models are trained with data from social media. This data may be innacturate or wrong.
 - Open AI does not reveal the code or the algorithims for GPT-2. So, it is hard to verify the legitimacy of the model.
